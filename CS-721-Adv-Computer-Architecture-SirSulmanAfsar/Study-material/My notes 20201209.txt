>>>>Role of Compiler............................
A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming
 language and turns them into machine language or
 "code" that a computer's processor uses. Typically, a programmer writes language statements in a
 language such as Pascal or C one line at a time using an editor.
 The file that is created contains what are called the source statements.
 The programmer then runs the appropriate language compiler,
 specifying the name of the file that contains the source statements.

>>>>Impact of Compiler Technology...........................
The need and desire to build compilers exerts pressure on the design and implementation of other parts of our computer systems.
 For example, consider some of the effects on language design:

We sometimes design languages so that they are easier to compile. This choice made more sense in the old days, when we understood
 less about how to write a compiler. These days, we should think of programmers first whenever practical.
The maturity of compiler technology makes it feasible for us to program on many platforms -- any platform with a processor.
Open-source compilers make languages open to extension and other language-processing tools more feasible to build.
Or on computer design:

designing computer systems aimed at a particular language (for example, the Lisp machine)
designing chips to support embedded programs
creating new kinds of architectures, such as RISC, with simpler and more uniform instruction sets, which simplify code generation
